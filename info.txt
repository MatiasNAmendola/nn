NSmart Programming Language

The programming language is intended to make the life of a ANN creator easier.

Currenlty, we are working on getting the basic grammer of the language up and running.

Uptil now the support for 
1. simple package creation
2. variable declaration / assignment
3. addition , subtraction, multiplication, division 
4. function definition
5. function calling ( though arguments are now only pass by value)
6. while loop
7. if -- else condition statement
8. CONNECTION , NODE , LAYER and NETWORK can be created similar to function definition style.
9. relational statements like && , ||, | , & , <, > , <= , >= , == , != are suppored 
10. argument stack framework for storing arguments and local variables for function.
11. implementing the support for having expression as argument for functions calling.
12. implementing the reference support, e.g. foo = &foo_bar OR foo(a,b,&c)
13. Basic support for IO commands is provided, (it is still not complete tho').
14. Grammar modified to enable IO functions of 
	PRINT, SCAN, READ, WRITE, OPEN, CLOSE
15. Partial Implementation of PRINT done.
16. Added support for Debug print statements
17. cleaned the unnecessary problems with relational statements.
18. Updated the makefile to be more flexible
19. Updated the makefile to consider parser/lexer generation seperately and nn executable seperately
	a. added commands are
		make base
		make all
		make clean
		make clean-base

20. Implemented the 'RETURN' statement
21. Some more improvements in IO for 'OPEN' 
22. Tested working 'OPEN' 'WRITE' 'CLOSE' sequence

----------- IMMEDIATE FUTURE WORK --------

1. Support for standard IO (work in progress)
2. array type and structuring of common data type (work in progress)
