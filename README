ABOUT nn
==========

nn is a special-purpose programming language developed for
creating, executing and training artificial neural network.

The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient,
complete).  

The language is still under heavy development.

INSTALLATION
============

After you download the nn source try
	make base
	make all

You will find the nn executable created under src/obj directory.


IF YOU RUN INTO TROUBLE
=======================

please drop me an email at nsmart-prog-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
we will try to resolve it as soon as we get to it.

For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public License,
my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that no nn 
script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put
said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any
object code linked with nn not automatically fall under the
terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions
of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the
resulting interpreter from executing any standard nn script.  I
consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral
equivalent of defining subroutines in the nn language itself.  You
may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide
or offer to provide the nn source, as specified by the GNU General
Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input
to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of
a running nn script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or
offer to provide the nn source as specified by the GPL.  (The
fact that a nn interpreter and your code are in the same binary file
is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation
of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding
my intent, feel free to contact me.
